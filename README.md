# Password Management System
This Python-based password management system allows users to securely store and manage their login credentials. Utilizing SQLite3 for database management, this system offers functionality to add, search, update, and remove password records.

# Motivation
The motivation behind this project was to explore and play with raw SQL commands within a Python environment. This project is a revamped version of an older initiative, updated and organized to align with contemporary practices in Python programming and database management. The primary goal was to understand the intricacies of SQL operations and Python's SQLite3 integration.

# Features
- Secure Login: Master password protection to access stored passwords.
- CRUD Operations: Create, read, update, and delete password records.
- Search Functionality: Easily search for specific login credentials.
- Password Generation: Option to generate random, secure passwords.
- Data Storage: Passwords are stored in a SQLite3 database for persistence and security.

# Note on Error Handling
This project has minimal error handling as it is not intended for a production environment. The focus is on demonstrating SQL operations and database interactions rather than building a robust application. Users should be aware that error handling is not extensively implemented.

# Requirements
* Python 3.x
* SQLite3
